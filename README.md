# LeadGeneration
Lead generation is a challenge that businesses have faced since the dawn of capitalism.  

# Background

To understand lead generation, let's first introduce the idea of a "sales funnel."

A sales funnel is simply a series of expected steps that a prospect undergoes before buying. Most businesses require sales funnels because visitors are not ready to become customers right away. 

# Objectives
For this challenge, a "conversion" is defined as a visitor who became a lead. 

* First, determine which sources/countries/devices had the highest conversion rates.
* Next, build a model that can predict conversion rate based on visitor information.
* What insights can you draw from your model? Which features were the most impactful?
* Finally, provide actionable insights to the business. What have we learned from this campaign?
